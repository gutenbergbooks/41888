No one can say that our
Motives are unworthy, for
our object is to instruct.
But there are some who
may object to our Methods,
and it is to such that we
offer, not an apology, but an explanation.
</p>

<p style='text-indent:0;'>
A very large section of the Public
cling to the belief that Law must be
as dry as Dust, and Accounting as
tedious as the Treadmill.
</p>

<p style='clear:left;'>
The truth is, it is not the Practice
of Law or of Accounting that is
uninteresting, but rather is it the
Theory which is often rendered so by
Teachers whom Providence never ordained
to teach.
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, the employment of unorthodox
methods helps to interest the
Student in his subject, and to stimulate
him to further effort, any apology
would be out of place.

De mortuo illo quid dicam?
"Nilnisi bonum" ut aiunt.
</p>

<p style='text-indent:0;'>
Sed quid si nil boni fecit?
De bonis licet loqui.
</p>

<p style='text-indent:0;'>
At si nulla bona reliquit?
De eo tacere decet: si neque
bonum fecit nec bona acquisivit nil valet.
</p>

<p style='text-indent:0;'>
Sed si bona reliquit in sermonem
hominum semper venit; vitia operta
sunt; pecuniam fecit, illa quidem "non
olet." Quem heredem instituit? Extraneis
haec omnia livori proxima videntur.
Te autem si tu aut cognatione aut affinitate
propinquus exspectatio tenet. An
mea interest? Si sic habet, quanti?
Suave est ex magno tollere acervo; ejus
pecunia quid non facere possim?
</p>

<p>
Siste, amice; aliquantulum cogita; supersunt
multi cognati; fieri potest ut aut cum
aliis bona partire debeas, aut exheredatus
sis.
</p>

<p>
Gerrae! Sine dubio testamentum fecit:
et cum ratione constat me alicuius rei legatarium
esse. Nemo enim magis eum fovit;
alii omnes cognati asseclae; solus eum amavi.
</p>

<p>
Insipiens, inter os et offam multa intervenire
possunt. Audi de gente Fulvia
fabellam: de multis mutato nomine narratur.
</p>

<p>
(In scena est coenatio Georgii Fusci, argentariorum
interpretis. Fuscus, bene coenatus,
alterum cyathum Falerni sorbillat.
Accurrit uxor, commota; in manu litteras
resignatas tenet).
</p>

<p>
U. Georgi!
</p>

<p>
F. Quid tibi nunc est? Num quid novi
est?
</p>

<p>
U. Amita mea Maria decessit!
</p>

<p>
F. Bene! nunquam postea illud vile Sabinum
necesse erit obsorbere: magnum est
solatium.
</p>

<p>
U. At tu Georgi semper id laudasti!
</p>

<p>
F. Et tu simul filiaeque semper miratae
estis Persicam illam detestabilem et psittacum
dissonum, et laudibus extulistis:
pretium fuit vetulae placere.
</p>

<p>
U. Esto: illa vero suavia erant. At hic
mihi litterae a cognitore ejus Semaureo
allatae: dicit se hodie vesperi te conventurum.
</p>

<p>
F. Demiror si testamentum fecit! Sin
minus omnia ad te perveniunt, tu heres ex
asse; cognati alii desunt.
</p>

<p>
U. Est quidem mariti nepos iste.
</p>

<p>
F. Nullus: tu sola heres: si intestata
omnia ad te.
</p>

<p>
U. Tabulas vere fecit: cognitor scribit se
te <ins class='correction' title='Original: conventurun'>conventurum</ins> quia testamentum ad rem
tuam maxime pertinet.
</p>

<p>
F. Mihi crede igitur! Aliquid magni tibi
legavit: haud verisimile illam quidquam
juveni Albo legasse: nunquam iliam observavit;
homo nil est nisi pictor ignotus aut
aliquid simile: uxorem quoque duxit quamdam
inopem, et eis saepe amita tua subvenire
debuit.
</p>

<p>
U. Fores pulsantur: advenit cognitor!
</p>

<p>
F. Dic famulae ut alteram cyathum ponat.
</p>

<p>
(Ingreditur Dominus Semaureus.)
</p>

<p>
Quid agis vir doctissime? Mea uxor
dixit te venturum; nonne ob testamentum
amitae ejus?
</p>

<p>
S. Sic res habet, Fusce; venio ad te quod
hoc res tua maxime refert; et scio te onus
suscepturum.
</p>

<p>
F. An sic habet? Vetulae illi multa bona
provenere ut opinor.
</p>

<p>
S. Permulta: super haec te consulendum
putavi. Hic mecum tabulas attuli ut eas
inspicias.
</p>

<p>
F. Bene est; Dignissima erat; cui semper
plurimum tribui. Falerni sume cyathum.
</p>

<p>
S. Benigne dicis; dimidium: bona venia
uxoris tuae est mihi in animo summas
testamenti reddere; ad illam quoque pertinet.
(Testamenta allata resignat.)
</p>

<p>
Post nonnulla famulis legata ita instituit:
</p>


<div class="blockquote">
<p>
"Fratris filiae Mariae lego Persicam
et Psittacum quae animalia tantopere
admirata est, certa fiducia se illis
hospitium praebituram; eidem etiam
lego annulum meum gemmatum.
Nepoti ejusdem Mariae viro Georgio
Fusco lego omne quod in hypogaeo
superest vinum illud Falernum quod
semper laudabat."
</p>
</div>

<p>
F. (In malam rem.)
</p>

<p>
S. "Quod ad ceteras possessiones Georgius
Fuscus heres esto ex asse: (subridet Fuscus
et uxori in aurem susurrat "ita ut dixi.")
</p>

<p>
S. (Conversa tabula) "et rogo eum ut
cum primum potuerit haereditatem adire,
omnibus et fundis et mobilibus venditis,
pecunias in cautionibus publica auctoritate
factis collocet et fructus reddat nepoti
mariti mei Jacobo Albo et uxori suae in
aetatem aut utri eorum vita superarit:
eis mortuis ut inter liberos eorum caput
dividat: aut liberis sine prole defunctis
caput reddat ad sodalitatem Anthropophagis
Africanis informandis et nutriendis
institutam: praemio sint fiduciario viginti
in annum librae."
</p>

<p>
F. Anus odiosa et malefica! At enitar ut
testamentum rescindatur; inofficiosi testamenti
querelam instituam! Delira fuit!
</p>

<p>
S. Immo mentis omnino compos fuit,
Improbe: sic summa fide clamabo et testabor.
Verba tua pro tempore et re indecora.
Tui piget me: evado.
</p>

<p>
F. Maria!
</p>

<p>
U. Georgi!
</p>

<p>
Uterque. Exsecrabilis Illa!

And when Joseph was dead his son

one Girl.
</p>

<p>
Now the elder of these two Sons was
comely to gaze upon and when he was yet

said unto him, "My Son, your Father's
Brother is old and nearing death. Take

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 4.
</h2>


<p>
Mr. Mordecai Moribund
was a pessimist during life
and died a violent death. His
facial appearance was much disfigured by
a sad squint, and this affliction to his
eyes contributed in no small degree to
the tragedy which at once deprived Mrs.
Moribund of a husband and a son. The
son, a bright youth of twenty summers,
had been sent down from Oxford University
by the authorities rather as a
warning to others than for any great
offence which he had committed. Nevertheless,
the disgrace was keenly felt by
his mother, and it was for this reason
that Mr. Moribund decided to take him
for a trip to India, until time had healed
the wound.
</p>

<p>
Arrived in India, Mr. Moribund
promised his son, Morton, to arrange
for a tiger shooting expedition. This
fatal promise caused all the trouble, for
Mr. Moribund, owing to his visual defects,
thought he observed a tiger approaching
from the west and forthwith discharged
his rifle. The bullet missed the tiger
and passed through the head of the unfortunate
Morton, who was thereby killed
on the spot. Mr. Moribund, horrified by
the accident, moved his position and slid
from the back of the elephant right into
the jaws of the infuriated animal. Assistance
was rendered immediately, and Mr.
Moribund was rescued from his unfortunate
position, but not before he had
sustained injuries from which he succumbed
four days subsequently.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Moribund, by his will, left everything
of which he was possessed to his
widow absolutely. This property, after
deducting debts, amounted to &pound;137,500,
but an examination of his affairs disclosed
the fact that two years previously he had
conveyed as an absolute gift to his son,
Morton, the sum of &pound;100,000. This
money had been invested by Morton in
Bearer Bonds of the Royal Japanese
Steamship Company at an average price
of &pound;80%, but on the date of Morton's
death these Bonds stood at &pound;120%.
Morton, by will, had left his entire fortune
to a Miss Flossie Teazle, an actress
whom he had met at Oxford.

It is a strange circumstance that little

families. At any rate Septimus
Hawkins had red hair and twelve children,
of whom eleven were living, but strangest

<p>
Very few men can state with any
degree of accuracy how long they
will live, but Nathaniel Hibbert
told his Wife he would die at 8 o'clock in
the morning of Tuesday, the 22nd April,
1913, and he did die at that very time
on that very day. He was standing on
some scaffolding when a platform gave
way under his very feet, and he broke
his spinal cord. In other words he was
hanged. His Solicitor urged him to make
a Will and the prison Chaplain added his
earnest entreaties, but Mr. Hibbert turned
a deaf ear to all such suggestions. Even
the sight of his Wife and only child did
not affect his determination, and he died
intestate.

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 7.
</h2>


<p>
Mr. Chicory loved his wife
almost as much as Mrs. Chicory
loved her husband. They had
lived together for nearly forty years, and
every Saturday morning throughout that
long time Mr. Chicory had faithfully
handed over to his wife his entire
earnings, which were not much, and
deducted only 5s. per week, which
served as pocket money for Mr.
Chicory, and enabled him to provide
coals during the winter months, collection
money at church, oil for the lamps,
and sundry presents from time to time to
his children, to say nothing of the Lame
Crossing Sweeper.
</p>

<p>
Each week a small sum was deposited
in the Post Office Savings Bank, and
when Mr. Chicory died, not only had he
to the credit of this account a balance of
&pound;108 0s. 10d., but his Cottage, which was
valued at &pound;90, was his own Freehold
Property. He had made a Will and paid
the Solicitor 10s. 6d. for drawing it up,
and nobody could have read what he said
about his old wife, to whom he left
everything, without feeling a lump in the
throat.
</p>

<p>
On the day of his funeral not one blind
was undrawn in all the Cottages round
about, and Mr. Michaelmas, the Carriage
Builder, sent a landau specially for Mrs.
Chicory. At least one hundred people
went to the Church, where the good old
Vicar read the Service, and the Lame
Crossing Sweeper painted his
broom-handle black.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Chicory, some weeks later, paid
the Solicitor another 10s. 6d., as a fee,
and asked him to do the rest.

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 8.
</h2>


<p>
Men who are mean during life and
who would grudge a present of
5s. to the postman at Christmas,
or who would spend a whole day in
another man's motor car and fail to tip
the Chauffeur at the end of the journey,
often prove very generous with their
money when they die and can no longer
enjoy the satisfaction of possession, which
during lifetime they cherished so dearly.
</p>

<p>
Such creatures usually bequeath their
property to Charitable Institutions at the
expense of deserving relatives, who have,
at any rate, in Equity, a claim to at least
some small share thereof.
</p>

<p>
The Law of Italy corrects this injustice,
and no man can will away at death the
whole of his property to strangers, if he
leaves a Widow or Relatives living of a
nearer kinship than a First Cousin.
</p>

<p>
Now Vincentio Dorando was an Italian
subject, whose nearest living relative was
a First Cousin once removed. He had
been educated at Oxford and had spent
the greater portion of his life in England,
but at the time of his death he was
domiciled in France. He left no property
of any sort in Italy or France, and no
duties were found to be payable in either
of these Countries. He had property in
England, however, which consisted of
&pound;15,000 Japanese 4<span class='numer'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>2</span>&frac12; per cent. Bonds at 94,
a Freehold House valued at &pound;2,500, and
some Furniture and Pictures which were
stored at Messrs. Hudson's Repository,
and which were valued for Probate at
&pound;480. The only debt due at death was a
Tailor's Bill for &pound;62.
</p>

<p>
He had made a perfectly valid Will in
England, by which he bequeathed all his
property, with the exception of his Real
Estate, to his old Oxford friend, Mr. James
Duncan, for life, with remainder over to
Mr. Duncan's eldest son. He left the
Freehold House to another Oxford friend,
Mr. Wallstone.

The Nurse described them as the
most wonderful Twins she had ever
seen; but then Monthly Nurses
always speak in this way!

The Mother said that she had never

<p>
Now John Gubbins, the grandson of
George Gubbins, founder of the Gubbins
Family, married Elizabeth Greatheart, on
Christmas-Day, and on the anniversary
of their wedding day little George Gubbins
first saw the light. But little George knew
not his father, for John Gubbins died when
George was but two months old.
</p>

<p>
In his Will John Gubbins appointed
his Cousin, George Gubbins, to be his
executor, and thus it was that George
Gubbins was brought into close touch
with the Widow Gubbins.
</p>

<p>
Friendship ripened into love and resulted
in Mrs. John Gubbins becoming Mrs.
George Gubbins. In due course Mrs.
George Gubbins presented her husband
with a little boy, who was christened John
after his first cousin once removed.
</p>

<p>
Little John grew in grace and played
very prettily with little George Gubbins,
who was his stepbrother and second cousin
rolled into one, and altogether it was a
very happy little party, until one day
little John's Father, George Gubbins, was
knocked down by a Steam Roller just in
front of his own house, and was rolled
into his own gravel drive.
</p>

<p>
Now the Steam Roller belonged to a
Company, of which Oscar Gubbins, son
of Charles Gubbins and grandson of
George Gubbins the Founder of the
Family, was a Director.
</p>

<p>
Hearing of the accident he hastened to
comfort the Widow in her affliction, and
succeeded so well that after a decent
interval had elapsed Mrs. George Gubbins
became Mrs. Oscar Gubbins.
</p>

<p>
A child was born two years later, three
months prior to the death of Oscar
Gubbins, the Father. The little boy was
christened Charles, and after the funeral
of Oscar Gubbins, Mrs. Gubbins took her
three little boys, George, John and Charles,
to Ventnor, in the Isle of Wight, for a
change of air.
</p>

<p>
It was in the lounge of the Sea View
Hotel at Ventnor that Mrs. Gubbins
met Mr. Charles Gubbins, first cousin to
her three late husbands.
</p>

<p>
Now Mr. Gubbins had ofttimes heard
of the much-weeded Widow, but when
he saw her for the first time with the
naked eye, he realised what happy men
John, George and Oscar Gubbins must
have been.
</p>

<p class='caption'>"When Mr. Charles Gubbins saw her for the first time
with the naked eye, he realised what happy men
John, George and Oscar Gubbins must have been."</p>
</div>

<p>
And when Mrs. Gubbins first saw Mr.
Charles Gubbins she thought how empty
widowhood really was, and what fine men
were the Grandsons of George Gubbins,
Founder of the Gubbins Family.
</p>

<p>
Such feelings were not to be denied,
and after three months of courtship Mr.
Charles Gubbins and Mrs. Oscar Gubbins
were declared man and wife by the Rev.
Stephen Collins.
</p>

<p>
For 10 years Mr. and Mrs. Charles
Gubbins lived together as happily as a
married couple could, and four beautiful
daughters, Rose, Violet, Daisy and Poppy
were born to them.
</p>

<p>
And then Mrs. Gubbins died intestate
leaving Personal Property valued for
Probate at &pound;12,000, and Real Property
valued at &pound;8,000.

Mrs. James Wardle's Husband died on
the 30th April, 1914. He was always called

Mr. Wardle had for many years left
his affairs entirely in the hands of his
Solicitor, but Mrs. Wardle, who was
Sole Executrix, thought&mdash;and very
properly too&mdash;that the combination of
a Solicitor and a Professional Accountant
was to be preferred. She therefore
journeyed to the City with the intention
of consulting her Stockbroker on the
matter, but by a curious Providential
dispensation, the Motor Omnibus broke
down just opposite Jones' office, and his
Brass Plate attracted the Sweet Lady's
attention!

of the beautiful Hymn, of which the first

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 15.
</h2>


<p>
The life of Hezekiah Hopkins had
been a warning rather than an
example to others, and the administration
of his affairs at death caused his
Executors and Trustees to use words
which are only permissible amongst gentlemen
when the ladies have withdrawn from
the dinner table.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hopkins died on the 25th June, 1913.
</p>

<p>
His Will had been proved, Estate
Duty and Legacy Duty had been paid,
but the Trust could not be closed owing
to the fact that the Residuary Estate
had been left to Nathaniel Hopkins, a
nephew, for life with remainder over to
the said Nathaniel's eldest god-son Walter
Blackside, subject to an annuity of &pound;200
which the Testator had <ins class='correction' title='Original: convenanted'>covenanted</ins> to
pay to the "Pride of Bristol," a prize
fighter, who had acted as bodyguard to
Mr. Hopkins during that gentleman's
earthly peregrinations.
</p>

<p>
The Residuary Estate consisted of the
following property:&mdash;
</p>


<div class="blockquote" style='text-indent:-1.5em;'>
<p>
(1) Leasehold Property having 30
years to run, producing &pound;900 per
annum. The property, which was
valued for probate at &pound;15,000, and
which was subject to a Ground Rent
of &pound;100 per annum, was sold on
on the 24th June, 1914, for &pound;16,400
and the proceeds invested on the
following day in Consols at 73, including
brokerage, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
(2) Deceased's Share in the firm of
Hezekiah Hopkins &amp;Co. This
amounted to &pound;18,000 upon the death
of Mr. Hopkins, and, according to
the Partnership Deed, was to be
paid out by instalments of &pound;6,500
a year including interest at 5% on
the unpaid balances. The first instalment
was to be paid on the first
anniversary of deceased's death.
</p>

<p>
(3) A Reversionary Interest in the
Estate of his Uncle Mr. John
Oppit, the life interest of which was
being enjoyed by Mrs. Oppit. This
Reversionary Interest was valued,
at the death of Mr. Hopkins for
probate purposes, at &pound;850, and was
retained until the 25th June, 1916,
when it fell into possession. It then
consisted of &pound;1,500 India 3<span class='numer'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>2</span>% at 88.
</p>

<p>
(4) &pound;10,000 invested in a Loan redeemable
on the 24th June, 1915, with
interest at 10% per annum payable
half-yearly on the 25th December
and the 24th June in each year.
</p>

<p>
The Trustees decided on their
own responsibility to retain this
investment, which was redeemed
on the due date and the interest
paid in the meanwhile.
</p>

<p>
(5) &pound;10,000 India 3% Stock at 84,
purchased by Deceased on 18th
June, 1913.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Upon the 25th June in each year the
balance of Corpus Realised was to be
placed on deposit with the Hong Kong
and Shanghai Bank at 4%, less any fraction
of &pound;100 which was to be retained on
Current Account at the Union of London

</p>

<p>
(2) The Coupons on the Chili 4%

</p>

<p>
(4) The Freehold House was let on a

<p>
(6) The Professional Accountant's fee
for writing up the books from the
22nd September, 1913, to 14th July,
1914, and making the necessary
adjustments was agreed at 100
guineas, and this fee was to be
apportioned between Mr. Gunter
and the Estate of Mrs. Wiggins
deceased equally.
</p>

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 17.
</h2>


<p>
Mr. Montagu Summers
had a conscientious objection to
the Income Tax, and a positive
loathing of the Super-Tax, and the trouble
lay in the fact that he had amassed a considerable
fortune in the City of London.
</p>

<p>
Something had to be done, however,
to relieve Mr. Summers of a portion of
this scandalous taxation, and so, converting
as much of his property into cash as he
could spare, he invested the same in
various ways in other countries.
</p>

<p>
He bought Russian 4<span class='numer'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>2</span>% Bonds in
Holland of the nominal value of 200,000
Guilders, and a Freehold Farm near
Amsterdam, which cost in English money
about &pound;8,000.
</p>

<p>
He bought Freehold Land in Canada,
for which he paid &pound;80,000, and deposited
with the Calgary Investment &amp;Security
Trust $300,000 at 5%.
</p>

<p>
He lent on Mortgage in New Zealand
&pound;40,000, and he had a balance of
Fcs. 8,600 to his credit at the Swiss
Bankverein, Berne.

<p class='caption'>"Mr. Montagu Summers had a conscientious objection to the
Income Tax, and a positive loathing of the Super-Tax."</p>
</div>

<p>
On the 14th November, 1913, Mr.
Summers died of blood poisoning, the
result of cutting a corn with a blunt razor.
</p>

<p>
His property in England consisted of
his Furniture and Effects valued at &pound;3,800,
Cash balance at the London, City &amp;Midland Bank, Queen Victoria Street,
&pound;300, and his interest as a Partner in the
firm of Montagu Summers &amp;Nephew,
which was agreed at &pound;32,640.
</p>

<p>
The Russian Bonds were sold on the
Amsterdam Exchange for 180,000 Guilders,
the Farm was valued at 112,800 Guilders,
and the Land in Canada was estimated
for duty purposes at $122,000.
</p>

<p>
Assuming the Death Duties in Holland
to be 5%, in Switzerland nil, and the
rates in the Colonies to be similar to what
they are in this Country, show what
Estate Duty would be payable in England.
</p>

<p>
The rates of Exchange can be taken as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p style='margin-left:4em; text-indent:0;'>
Holland&mdash;12 Guilders = &pound;1<br />
Switzerland&mdash;25 Francs = &pound;1<br />
Canada&mdash; 5 Dollars = &pound;1

All accruing income to be ignored.

PROBLEM No. 18.

<p>
Mr. Harold Wimpole died
in his Opera Hat, and was
buried in Willesden Cemetery.
</p>

<p>
His Will had been proved, Estate Duty
had been paid, and the Widow, who was
the sole Beneficiary, had found considerable
consolation in the &pound;56,200 which had come
to her.
</p>

<p>
This &pound;56,200 represented the Gross
Estate, less Debts due by Mr. Wimpole
at his death &pound;1,416, Funeral Expenses
&pound;39 17s. 0d. which were regarded by all,
including the Inland Revenue Authorities,
as most reasonable, Estate Duty, Interest
on Estate Duty &pound;31 16s. 0d., Testamentary
Expenses &pound;140 3s. 0d. and Legacy Duty.

<p class='caption'>"The Curate looked at the Widow,

</div>

<p>
Eight months had passed away and the
rules of Society permitted Mrs. Wimpole
to smile occasionally; the Curate, who
took an extraordinary interest in Mrs.
Wimpole's salvation and the carving of
an ancient Japanese Cabinet, had called
for tea. The Reverend gentleman, with
a sandwich in his hand, was recording the
incidents connected with the birth of
Buddha, when his fingers happened to
touch the spring of a secret drawer in
the aforementioned Cabinet.
</p>

<p>
The Curate looked at the Widow, and
the Widow looked at the Curate, and
there they stood together, hand in hand,
like two young children, in silent amazement,
for the secret drawer in the Japanese
Cabinet disclosed 25 4<span class='numer'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>2</span>% Foreign Government
Bonds to Bearer, of the nominal
value of &pound;500 each, and several memoranda
of Stock Exchange dealings between Mr.
Wimpole and his Broker. The coupons
were payable on the 10th March, and the
10th September in each year, and the
last coupon which had been cut off was
dated 10th September, 1912, exactly 8
months previous to the death of Mr.
Wimpole. Mrs. Wimpole consulted the
Reverend Oscar Veritas long and earnestly
over the matter, and the Reverend Oscar
admitted that it was a case necessitating
very great firmness of character and
honesty of purpose. Ultimately, however,
he arrived at the conclusion that
Mrs. Wimpole would be unworthy
to bear his name in the future, unless
she did her duty in the present instance.
</p>

<p>
What was the pecuniary value of the
good man's conclusions to the Inland
Revenue in the matter of Estate and
Legacy Duty, bearing in mind the fact
that the Bonds stood at 92 on the day of
Mr. Wimpole's death, and 90, ten months
later when Mrs. Wimpole's Solicitor finally
settled the matter?

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 19.
</h2>


<p>
Sir Robert Rushforth, J.P.,
was a big man with a big heart and
a wooden leg. He had inherited
a fortune, gone bankrupt, and married a
Widow, and if anyone had told him he
wasn't a sportsman he would have
called that individual a liar, and opened
a second bottle.
</p>

<p>
He died on the 4th June, leaving all
his property to his Widow, with the
exception of his wooden leg, which he
directed to be handed over to the Royal
Hospital for Incurables, at Putney.
</p>

<p>
Such was the man, and the contents of
his Will so exactly reflected the character
of her husband that Lady Rushforth at
once had recourse to the smelling salts
on reading the document.
</p>

<p>
He directed the debts, from which he
had obtained a legal discharge in Bankruptcy,
to be paid in full, he forgave all
his Debtors, and instructed his Widow,
whom he had appointed sole Executrix
and Residuary Legatee, to meet in full
all his Gaming Debts. He further
directed that a certain debt, in respect
of which he had pleaded in his younger
days the Statutes of Limitation, should be
paid in full.
</p>

<p>
The name of this latter creditor was
Gunter, and the debt, amounting to &pound;25,
was in respect of repairs to certain pigsties.
</p>

<p>
The discharge from Bankruptcy had
been obtained by Sir Robert eight years
previous to his death. His liabilities had
amounted to &pound;16,200, and he had paid
2s. 6d. in the &pound;.
</p>

<p>
He owed his bookmaker, Mr. Hollins,
of Houndsditch, &pound;200.
</p>

<p>
He had lent his Vicar, the Rev. Aaron
Cranium, &pound;100, his sister Blanche &pound;300,
and his intimate but impecunious friend,
Mr. Algernon O'Gizzard, &pound;50. This latter
loan was rendered necessary by reason
of the fact that Mr. O'Gizzard had stood
bail for a friend who had got into trouble
with the police, and who failed to put
in an appearance before the Magistrates
on the day appointed. Now, Sir Robert
happened to be on the Bench that morning,
and ordered the bail to be estreated
before he realised with whom he was dealing.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the above property Sir
Robert left Personal Estate valued at
&pound;62,000. There was no Real Property.

Duty were payable upon Sir Robert's
death.

<p>
Mr. James Hotchkiss died
in the autumn of age on the
morning of his 93rd birthday.
</p>

<p>
During his protracted life he had
always surrounded himself with every
comfort, and was reputed to be an
exceedingly rich man.
</p>

<p>
No wonder then that his death should
occasion an unparalleled outburst of grief
and hatbands on the part of his weeping
relatives.
</p>

<p>
After the funeral, the chief mourners
met in the library and the Family Solicitor,
with a glass of wine within easy reach,
read out the last Will and Testament of
James Hotchkiss Deceased.
</p>

<p>
This interesting document brought a
ray of comfort to bleeding hearts, for
several substantial Legacies were mentioned,
all free of duty, and two at
least of the prospective Legatees were
observed to make rapid calculations on
the left shirt cuff.

</p>

Cattle, <i>i.e.</i>, Cows, and &pound;20,000.
</p>

<p>
To Rachel and Joyce Proudfoot ("my

&pound;10,000 each. The Misses
Proudfeet were aged 32 and 27

To Richard, William and Algernon
Hotchkiss ("my never-to-be-forgotten

The Residue of the Estate was bequeathed
absolutely to the Widow.
</p>

<p>
The Executors lost no time in having
the Property valued and the debts due
by the deceased at his death, ascertained,
and their efforts disclosed "a very lamentable
state of affairs," at least, such was
the opinion expressed by the Reverend
Stephen Collins who had called to comfort
the Widow in her affliction.
</p>

<p>
The Horses, Carriages, Motor Car, &amp;c.,
including the Landscape by Earp, were
valued at &pound;2,000; the Horn&egrave;d Cattle, <i>i.e.</i>,
the Cows, were put down at &pound;400, and
the rest of the Property at &pound;40,893 16s 0d.
</p>

<p>
The Debts due by the deceased amounted
to &pound;1,720 0s. 0d., and the Funeral Expenses
to &pound;339 7s. 0d. These latter were
considered unreasonable by the Inland
Revenue Authorities, and in spite of
several very eloquent appeals addressed
to them by the Executors, including a
touching letter from the Reverend Stephen
Collins dealing with the blameless life of
the deceased, the amount allowed was
fixed at &pound;33 16s. 0d.

PROBLEM No. 21.
</h2>


<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Turvey were
justly proud of their son
"'Erbert." He was their only
child, and always wore a Frock Coat,
Brown Boots and White Spats on Sunday.
In fact, as everyone said, he gave a tone
to Bethnal Green.
</p>

<p>
But the ways of Providence are strange,
and it is futile to seek for explanations
where none are vouchsafed. It is enough
to say that Mr. Herbert's anatomy came
into violent contact with a brewer's dray
one Thursday afternoon, and that a
promising young life was cut short at the
early age of 19.
</p>

<p>
His Life Story has yet to be written,
and it is but the barest outline that can
be here recorded.
</p>

<p>
At the age of 16 he made the acquaintance
of Miss Harriett Hopkins. In the
following spring he had successfully
reached the "walking out" stage. He
was formally engaged at the age of 17
and at 18 he was married. Six weeks
before he died he made two very
remunerative investments. He borrowed
from his Employers&mdash;without worrying
them about so small a matter&mdash;the sum
of &pound;6, which he converted into &pound;600 by
successfully backing "Hump Back" at
100 to 1 for the "Cesarewitch." He also
insured his life for &pound;100.
</p>

<p>
Having satisfactorily adjusted the small
matter of the Loan without in any way
arousing his Employers' suspicions, he
joined a Burial Club, made a Will, and
died ten days later.
</p>

<p>
By his Will he appointed his Widow
sole Executrix, and divided his Estate as
to one-fourth part to his father Oliver
Turvey, as to one-sixth part to a former
landlady Mrs. Korphdrop, and the residue
to his Widow.
</p>

<p>
The Estate consisted of the following:&mdash;
</p>


<div class='blockquote'>
<p>Cash &pound;564.</p>

<p>Insurance Policy, &pound;100.</p>

<p>Burial Club Money &pound;14.</p>

<p>Household Furniture and Effects &pound;12.</p>
</div>

<p>
The Funeral Expenses amounted to &pound;12.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Herbert Turvey was buried on
the third Thursday after Guy Fawkes'
Day, and on the following Tuesday
fortnight the Widow gave birth to a
son. Both mother and child progressed
amazingly and everybody called to visit
Harriett, but chiefly to satisfy their
curiosity as to the amount which she inherited.

<p>
Mrs. George Dumpkins
was very vexed that any Estate
Duty at all should be payable,
and when she was told that a Corrective
Affidavit would have to be presented she
threatened to change her Solicitors. As
she very properly said she had sufficient
troubles already without having to pay
for more, and the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, whoever he was, ought to be
ashamed of himself for taxing Widows so
scandalously.
</p>

<p>
She entirely disagreed with the opinion
of her Solicitor as to the necessity of
presenting this Corrective Affidavit, and
insisted upon having Counsel's opinion on
the matter. The following facts were
therefore submitted to the learned gentleman:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Dumpkins' Estate had been proved
for Probate purposes at &pound;71,000, but
during the year after death the following
Assets were realised and Liabilities settled, viz.:&mdash;

<div class="blockquote" style='text-indent:-1.5em;'>

Share in Ship valued at &pound;4,000,
realised &pound;3,500.
</p>

<p>
Sundry Liabilities estimated for Probate
at &pound;8,000, were subsequently
found to be &pound;8,700. (This included
&pound;75 cost of bringing deceased's body
from abroad.)
</p>

<p>
Stock-in-Trade valued at &pound;10,250,
realised &pound;9,400.
</p>

<p>
&pound;6,000 Mortgage Debentures valued at

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 24.
</h2>


<p>
Mr. Justice Oats died in
harness. He worked like a
horse throughout his long career
on the Bench, and was universally regarded
as a thoroughbred sportsman. For
nearly 25 years he had been a Judge of
the Probate Division of the High Court
of Justice, and like many others in a
similar position, died intestate. Not that
this was the intention of the learned
Judge, for he had prepared a Will on
the back of an envelope, but forgetting
that even he was subject to the laws of
the land, had entirely overlooked the
necessity for signing it. He died, therefore, intestate.
</p>

<p>
His Net Estate, after the payment of
the Estate Duty on the Personal Property,
amounted to &pound;68,570, of which the Real
Property was valued at &pound;24,200.
</p>

<p>
For many years the Judge had been a
Widower, and his only child had died in
infancy. His youngest brother, Alfred,
was living, however, and he had a nephew,
the son of his deceased brother Charles.
The Judge had, in addition, three first
cousins, one of whom was a lady who
had thrice refused offers of marriage, the
acceptance of any one of which would
have made her Lady Oats. She was,
however, a Quakeress, and her enemies
hinted that she refused the Judge lest
the combination of the name of her
religious faith and her marriage name
should bring upon her the nickname of
"Lady Porridge."

PROBLEM No. 25.
</h2>


<p>
The following letter was received
by the Rev. Stephen Collins on
the 22nd March, 1914:&mdash;
</p>


<div class="blockquote">


<div class="ralign">

</p>

<p>
<i>21st March, 1914.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
My dear Mr. Collins,
</p>

<p>
As an old and much honoured
friend of my late husband may I implore
you to be with us at breakfast on Tuesday,
the 1st April, at 9 a.m.?
</p>

<p>
My son Montgomery comes of age on
that day and I feel that it would be
a particularly appropriate occasion for
his Vicar to say a few words on the
seriousness of life, and the responsibilities
of riches.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you do not know that my
husband left everything to me except
&pound;10,000 India 3<span class='numer'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>2</span>% Stock which he bequeathed
(in my opinion misguidedly) to
our two boys, Montgomery and Algernon,
in equal shares. At the date of the
Colonel's death, six years ago, these were
valued at 102, but now, alas, are worth
no more than 90. The Income up to the
6th January last has been regularly handed
over to the boys in accordance with their
father's wishes, but on the 1st April, &pound;5,000
of the Stock will have to be sold and
handed over to Monty.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Crawley, my Solicitor, has promised
to be present, and I have sent invitations
to my Stockbroker, Professional
Accountant, and the Bank Manager.
</p>

<p>
Do come, dear Mr. Collins,
</p>


<div class="ralign" style='margin-right:2em;'>
<p>
And believe me to remain,
</p>
</div>


<div class="ralign" style='margin-right:4em;'>
<p>
Yours very sincerely,
</p>
</div>


<div class="ralign" style='margin-right:8em;'>
<p>
AUGUSTA MAWSTONE.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<p>
<i>Note.</i>&mdash;The breakfast was a great success.
Everybody turned up and the Rev.
Stephen Collins spoke for 47 minutes.
The &pound;5,000 Stock was sold at 90 net,
and the necessary entries were made
in the books of the Trust, showing
the settlement of Montgomery's
interest in the Estate.

PROBLEM No. 27.

<p>
Colonel Filbert, stepson to
the late Sir Hazel Knut, paid a
brief visit to the Brazils, and
died on the voyage home on the
1st January, 1914.
</p>

<p>
He left a considerable Estate, and bequeathed
many useful Legacies, all free of
Duty, to deserving Relations and Friends.
One of the provisions in his Will was to
the effect that a sum of &pound;5,300 should be
placed on Deposit at the Bank to be paid
over by instalments at regular intervals
to his two Executors, John Bunting
and Nathaniel Whittel, and was to be
regarded by them as a Salary for their
services.
</p>

<p>
Each was to receive a Starting Salary
at the rate of &pound;500 per annum, but whereas
John Bunting's Salary was to be increased
by &pound;100 per annum, Nathaniel Whittel's
Salary was to be increased by &pound;25 half-yearly.
</p>

<p>
As soon as the &pound;5,300 was exhausted
the Salaries were to cease, and in the
meanwhile the Interest on the Deposit
was to be paid over to the General Estate.
</p>

<p>
The Salaries were to be drawn half-yearly,
the first to be payable exactly six
months from the date of Colonel Filbert's death.

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 28.
</h2>


<p>
Every Sportsman will admit that
it is immoral to bet upon
a certainty, and most business
men will endorse the maxim that
only fools speculate without inside information.
</p>

<p>
Now Mr. Hunter never gambled, but
he was open, like most other men, to a
sound speculation, and when he learned
in his capacity of Clerk to a well-known
Solicitor that Miss Rose Tulip had inherited
a fortune of &pound;60,000 odd, he naturally felt
interested.
</p>

<p>
Many obstacles separated Mr. Hunter
from the object of his choice, but he
persevered, and on one particularly sunny
afternoon he let loose a chance arrow with
such well-directed aim that Miss Tulip's
heart was forthwith pierced.
</p>

<p>
The Engagement caused some little
flutter in the Dove Cot, and Lady
Tulip, Miss Rose's widowed Mother, at
once changed her Solicitors in spite of a
promise on their part to decorate Mr.
Hunter with the "Order of the Boot,"
a promise which was promptly converted
into an accomplished fact.
</p>

<p>
Every effort was made to induce Miss
Rose to reconsider her decision, but this
only seemed to lead to further complications,
for on the 14th July Mr. George
Tulip announced his engagement to Mr.
Hunter's only sister, Rebecca.
</p>

<p>
This was the last straw and the lamentations
of the proud Tulip Family were
only exceeded by the rejoicings of the
Family Hunter.
</p>

<p>
The prospective Bridegrooms met and
made all the necessary arrangements, and
Mr. Hunter, who had had a legal training,
drew up four simple Wills whereby each
left to the Widow, or Widower, all the
worldly goods of which he, or she, was
possessed.
</p>

<p>
These documents were signed and witnessed,
and four days later the double
wedding was solemnized quietly at the
Church of Saint Augustine.
</p>

<p>
After the ceremony Mr. and Mrs.
Hunter and Mr. and Mrs. Tulip journeyed
to Liverpool Street Station and caught
the 2 o'clock train to Clacton, where the
honeymoon was to be spent.
</p>

<p>
They arrived comfortably in time for
tea, and Mr. Hunter insisted on treating
the whole party to Winkles.
</p>

<p>
Now, whether it was the Winkles or
whether it was the pins, is a matter upon
which the two London Specialists who
were called in failed to agree, but the
fact remains that within a very short
time of devouring the aforementioned
delicacies, the whole party became alarmingly
ill, and two days later Mr. Tulip
and Mrs. Hunter died.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tulip's Estate, which consisted
entirely of Personalty, was valued for
Probate at &pound;8,420, and Mrs. Hunter's
Estate, which consisted entirely of Realty,
was valued at &pound;72,422.

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 29.
</h2>


<p>
The Rev. Stephen Collins delivered
a very moving address on Total
Abstinence at the Mothers' Meeting
on the 14th June, 1913, and three weeks
later Mr. Gunter died.
</p>

<p>
Now some of the parishioners were
inclined to connect the two events,
particularly as Mrs. Gunter happened
to form one of the band of Mothers
on that memorable occasion, and was
known to have given her husband Toast
and Water for Supper on the following
evening.
</p>

<p>
Be that as it may, it is an undoubted
fact that Mr. Gunter, in a codicil to his
Will, nominated the Rev. Stephen Collins
in place of Mrs. Gunter as Life Tenant
of the Income arising from the property
of which he (Mr. Gunter) died possessed.
</p>

<p>
After the payment of all Duties, Debts
and Expenses, this property consisted of
Assets producing Income as follows:&mdash;
</p>


<div class="blockquote" style='text-indent:-1.5em;'>
<p>
(1) &pound;300 per annum, free of tax,
payable quarterly on the usual
quarter days.
</p>

<p>
(2) &pound;160 per annum, free of tax,
payable half-yearly, on the 30th June
and 31st December.
</p>

<p>
(3) &pound;140 per annum, free of tax,
payable yearly, on the 29th September.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Income was received regularly on
the due dates and the Reverend Gentleman
had given a formal receipt for everything
due up to and including the 31st December,
1913.
</p>

<p>
On the 30th April, 1914, Stock No. 1
was sold cum. div. at a profit of &pound;500,
and the proceeds were re-invested in a
security, the income from which was
&pound;320 per annum, free of tax, payable
half-yearly on the 30th June and
31st December.
</p>

<p>
On the 20th June, 1914, Stock No. 2
was sold ex. div. at a loss of &pound;100,
and the proceeds were re-invested in a
Stock ex. div. bringing in &pound;140 per annum,
free of tax, payable quarterly on the usual
quarter days.
</p>

<p>
The Rev. Stephen Collins recognises
that the Trustees are honourable men and
that their intentions are worthy, but nevertheless
he is anxious and wishes to be in
a position to reassure Mrs. Collins as to
the income which he will receive for the
year ending 31st December, 1914.
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that Mr. Collins
has now published the Address delivered
at the Mothers' Meeting on the 14th June,
1913, trusting that the seed sown broadcast
may find its way into fruitful soil.

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 30.
</h2>


<p>
A prosperous Solicitor usually
occupies very dirty offices, and
his furniture is mostly Mid-Victorian
and rickety.
</p>

<p>
Mr. John Storalore was no exception
to this rule and never seemed to object
to such surroundings, but on the contrary
always appeared to be surrounded by
such objects.
</p>

<p>
He was sitting in his office one June
afternoon and was dozing over some
particularly dusty documents when his
clerk announced Sir Pufferby Pawstone.
Now Sir Pufferby was an important
client who always had his hair cut and
called on his Solicitor when he found himself
with nothing better to do. It is not
surprising, therefore, that Mr. Storalore
should receive him with open arms and
assume a very profound expression.
</p>

<p>
After the usual courtesies had been exchanged,
and Lady Pawstone's health
touched upon, Sir Pufferby announced
that he desired to make a Will.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Storalore was all attention and
took elaborate notes of Sir Pufferby's
testamentary wishes, which were extensive
and complicated. This done, Sir Pufferby
begged Mr. Storalore to give him a brief
and concise account of the steps which it
is necessary for Executors and Trustees
to take in the administration of the affairs
of a deceased person from the moment of
death up to the final distribution of the
Residue.
</p>

<hr /> <!--
<tb>
 -->

<p>
Do not worry about what Mr.
Storalore actually said to Sir Pufferby,
for Sir Pufferby was an old woman,
and Mr. Storalore knew his client, but
say what he would have said to you in
answer to such a question.

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 31.
</h2>


<p>
Mr. George Huggins died
on the 31st October, 1913, and
with the exception of a few
legacies, bequeathed free of duty, he left
the whole of his property to his Widow
for life with remainder over to his friend
Mr. Giblets, provided that gentleman outlived
Mrs. Huggins.
</p>

<p>
Now this arrangement placed Mr.
Giblets in an embarrassing predicament,
especially as Mrs. Huggins' health improved
so wonderfully after her husband's death.
</p>

<p>
It appeared to Mr. Giblets, therefore,
that matrimony was the only safe solution
of the difficulty, and so he went on his
knees before the Widow. But the lady
grasped the situation immediately, and
declined the honour.
</p>

<p>
Friendship being thus early at an end
Mr. Giblets resolved to worry the Widow,
bearing in mind the saying that "Worry
kills." So he set himself to quibble
about every detail in the administration
of the late Mr. Huggins' Estate,
particularly as regards the apportionment
of Revenue between Capital and Income.
But the Widow would not worry, and
wisely suggested to the Solicitors that all
matters involving accounts should be left
to some first-class Firm of Professional
Accountants to settle.
</p>

<p>
This was done, and the following are
the Cash Receipts and Payments made
by the Trustees up to the 30th June,
1914.

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 32.
</h2>


<p>
Mr. Nathaniel Soworthy, a great
breeder of prize pigs, had the
misfortune to be knocked down
one day by his favourite Berkshire Boar,
and his head was cut open on the corner
of the pig-sty. Notwithstanding the fact
that Mr. Soworthy prided himself exceedingly
on the extreme cleanliness of his
pig-sties, where, as he was often heard to
say, he would be quite ready to eat his
own dinner, he discovered on that lamentable
occasion what must have been the
sole surviving microbe on the premises
which, entering his circulation, set up
blood poisoning with the result that
he passed away a few days later, viz.,
at 6 p.m. on the evening of the 31st
January, 1914.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Soworthy was a man of many
hobbies, and in addition to his prize
pigs he possessed a unique collection of
silver salt-cellars reputed to be one of the
finest in the country. This was valued
for Probate at &pound;5,000, while the pigs were
estimated to be worth &pound;2,500.
</p>

<p>
In addition he died possessed of the
following property:&mdash;
</p>


<div class="blockquote" style='text-indent:-1.5em;'>
<p>
&pound;5,000 India 3% quoted at 75<span class='numer'>3</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>8</span>-<span class='numer'>7</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>8</span>.
</p>

<p>
10,000 Ordinary Shares of &pound;1 each in
the Improved Pork Pie Factory,
Ltd., valued at 25/- per share.
</p>

<p>
&pound;4,000 Mortgage at 4<span class='numer'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>2</span>% on the farm
known as "Little Watchem," interest
payable 30th September and
31st March, paid to 30th September, 1913.
</p>

<p>
Cash in the house, &pound;15.
</p>

<p>
Cash at the Bank &pound;355 on Current
Account and &pound;2,000 on deposit at
3%, interest payable 30th June and
31st December.
</p>

<p>
&pound;5,000 Policy in the Live Stock
Breeders' Mutual Assurance Society,
upon which the Bonus at the date
of death amounted to &pound;190.
</p>

<p>
Household <ins class='correction' title='Original: Gods'>Goods</ins>, Horses, and Motor
Car, &pound;3,500.
</p>

<p>
Implements of Husbandry, &pound;150.
</p>

<p>
The Freehold Estate, comprising
Mansion House, Park, and Home
Farm known as "The Piggeries,"
valued at &pound;15,000, subject to a
Mortgage of &pound;10,000 at 4<span class='numer'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>2</span>%,
interest payable 30th November and
31st May, paid to 30th November, 1913.
</p>

<p>
He was also life tenant of Real Property
producing &pound;3,000 per annum,
in respect of which there was income
accrued due but not received prior
to death amounting to &pound;900.
</p>
</div>

<p>
By his Will he left the following bequests:
</p>


<div class="blockquote" style='text-indent:-1.5em;'>
<p>
&pound;1,000 in trust to the President for the
time being of the Royal Society for
the Propagation and Improvement of
Pigs, to be invested and the interest
awarded annually in prizes for the
best sucking pigs.
</p>

<p>
&pound;100 to the Perennial Society of Whole
Hoggers, of the local branch of
which he was the esteemed and
Honorary President; and
</p>

<p>
His famous White Sow, known as
the "Soworthy Sow," to his lifelong
friend the celebrated judge
of pigs, Mr. Anthony Golightly Wackenbath.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The prize pigs were directed to be sold
and realised &pound;2,690. The collection of
silver salt-cellars was bequeathed to the
Victoria and Albert Museum on condition
that it should be shown as a whole and
named the Soworthy Collection. This
bequest was accepted.
</p>
<div class='center'>

    title='"His famous White Sow, known a...' alt='"His famous White Sow, known a...'
  /></a>
<p class='caption'>"His famous White Sow, known as the 'Soworthy Sow.'"</p>
</div>

<p>
The debts due at death amounted to
&pound;215, and the funeral expenses to &pound;45.
</p>

<p>
Within a week of the funeral the famous
Soworthy Sow died in giving birth to a fine
litter of ten little pigs, two of which unfortunately
pre-deceased their Mother. The
result of this event had been awaited
before sending the Sow to Mr. Wackenbath,
who was thus deprived of this mark of
the deceased gentleman's affection. The
value of the Sow alive had been &pound;50,
but dead she was not worth more than
&pound;3 10s. 0d., while the litter, whose father
was the same Berkshire Boar that had been
the unwitting cause of Mr. Soworthy's
death, were worth &pound;2 a-piece.

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 35.
</h2>


<p>
To anyone not in the secret, the
conduct of Mr. Pipkin would appear
inexplicable, for on March 3rd,
1914, he very deliberately entered a
Tobacconist's shop, ordered a threepenny
cigar, and afterwards resigned
his position as Assistant Book-keeper
in Messrs. Macfarlane's Grocery Establishment.
</p>

<p>
The secret, however, lay in the fact
that Mrs. Pipkin had come into money,
and Mr. Pipkin very naturally felt himself
independent of other people and yearned
for the ease and comfort appertaining to
the position of a retired gentleman of means.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Pipkin's fortune consisted of a life
interest in the Property left by Mr. Austen
Friars, who died on the 28th February, 1914.
</p>

<p>
This property was represented by the
following assets:&mdash;
</p>


<div class="blockquote" style='text-indent:-1.5em;'>
<p>
&pound;2,000 3<span class='numer'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>2</span>% Hongkong Stock, interest
payable half-yearly, on the 1st April
and 1st October.
</p>

<p>
200 Shares of &pound;5 each (&pound;2 10s. 0d. called
up and paid) in the Commercial
Banking Co., Ltd.
</p>

<p>
Freehold House bringing in &pound;80 a year,
payable quarterly, on the usual
Quarter Days.  This house was
assessed at &pound;67, and the Income
Tax was paid by the Tenant on the
5th January, 1914.
</p>

<p>
750 &pound;1 Shares, fully paid, in the
Perpetual Rays Co., Ltd.
</p>
</div>

<p>
April, 1914, was the very happiest
month in Mr. Pipkin's whole life, and
he spent most of his time smoking his
pipe in his back garden, or improving
his mind by contemplating the educative
pictures of the local Cinema.
</p>

<p>
The months of May and June, however,
did not prove quite so pleasant, and
by the middle of July Mr. Pipkin actually
threatened Mrs. Pipkin that unless she
kept the baby quiet he would look out
for another job.
</p>

<p>
And then August came round which
proved to be the most miserable month
of Mr. Pipkin's whole life, for Mrs.
Pipkin was suddenly taken ill after consuming
a liberal portion of Tinned Salmon.
Never before did he realise how much he
loved his Wife or what a blow to his heart
her death would be. He never left her
bedside and he spared no expense, but, in
spite of all, Mrs. Pipkin passed away on
the 19th August, 1914.
</p>

<p>
It would be idle to attempt to depict
Mr. Pipkin's feelings; it is enough to say
that he became a poorer but a wiser man.
</p>

<p>
On the 3rd April, 1914, a dividend for
the year ending 31st January, 1914, at the
rate of 7<span class='numer'>1</span>&frasl;<span class='denom'>2</span>% was declared on the 200 shares
in the Commercial Banking Co., Ltd., and
a similar dividend was declared on the
4th April, 1915, in respect of the year
ending 31st January, 1915.
</p>

<p>
On the 19th August, 1914, a final dividend
at the rate of 15% per annum, free
of tax, was declared on the 750 Shares in
the Perpetual Rays Co., Ltd., for the
half year ending 30th June, 1914. An
interim dividend had been received on
the 31st January, 1914, in respect of the
half year ending 31st December, 1913,
at the rate of 10% per annum, free
of tax.
</p>

<p>
No interim dividend was paid during
the Company's year ending 30th June,
1915; but on the 31st July, 1915, a
dividend at the rate of 10%, free of tax,
was declared in respect of the year ending
30th June, 1915.

<h2>
PROBLEM No. 37.
</h2>


<p>
The late Mr. John Bunyon died
in affluent circumstances after
having, by the exercise of keen
business instincts, overcome those obstacles
which confront every great
philanthropist who combines the cause
of humanity with the desire to achieve
wealth and fame.
</p>

<p>
In his early days he vended to a
suffering but suspicious public, a commodity
known as "Bunyon's Specific";
and it was his custom at this time to
commence his nightly oration to his
potential patients at the street corner
with the words, "Ladies and Gentlemen,
I have extracted corns from all the
Crowned Heads of Europe."
</p>

<p>
In later years, when by the aid of
judicious advertising he had convinced
the public that no home was complete
without his famous Specific, Mr. Bunyon
sold his business to a Limited Company,
and on then calculating his wealth,
found himself rich beyond the dreams
of avarice.
</p>

<p>
He thereupon decided to enter Society,
and after some difficulty procured an
introduction to Mr. James Rooker, who
obtained for him&mdash;for a consideration&mdash;the
entr&eacute;e into that sphere of Social life
which he was so eminently fitted to
adorn. On Mr. Rooker's advice, he
purchased a Freehold House in a
favourable quarter of the West End
of London, but owing to a desire not to
disturb certain Investments, he raised
&pound;2,500 of the purchase price by Mortgage,
which at the time of his decease
had not been repaid.
</p>

<p>
In view of the great services rendered
to him by Mr. James Rooker, Mr.
Bunyon promised to remember him and
his family in his Will; which led Mr.
Rooker to be very solicitous concerning
Mr. Bunyon's health until he was certain
that a Will had been executed, and
subsequently caused him much speculation
as to whether an early decease of
his Patron might not be more beneficial
than the advantages to be gained from
him whilst alive.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bunyon's death put an end to
these speculations, and it occurred under
the following circumstances. Having met
Mr. Rooker by appointment at that
gentleman's house, they spent a merry
hour at the card table, much to Mr.
Rooker's advantage. They then sallied
forth in a Taxi-cab; when suddenly
remembering that he had parted with
all his ready cash, and knowing that
Mr. Rooker never paid for cabs on
principle, Mr. Bunyon ordered the
chauffeur to drive to Attenborough's and
there placed his diamond pin in pledge
for the sum of &pound;5. Feeling somewhat
faint after this exertion, he instructed
the chauffeur to drive to a Chemist's
where he ordered a pick-me-up. The
Chemist not knowing his customer,
considered his symptoms a fit case for
a dose of "Bunyon's Specific," of which
Mr. Bunyon unwittingly partook, and so
met his death.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Bunyon's Will was found to
contain the following Legacies and
Devises in favour of the Rooker Family:&mdash;
</p>


<div class="blockquote" style='text-indent:-1.5em;'>
<p>
Mr. James Rooker, my Diamond Pin.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Tracey Rook Rooker, 1,000
Shares in "Bunyon, Ltd."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Ricardo Rook Rooker,  my
Freehold House in London.
</p>

<p>
Miss Christabel Rook Rooker, &pound;100
of Consols out of my &pound;2,000
Consols.
</p>

<p>
Miss Emmeline Rook Rooker, &pound;100
payable out of my &pound;2,000 Consols.
</p>
</div>

<p>
It was found that both the Shares in
"Bunyon, Ltd." and the Consols, had
been sold shortly before Mr. Bunyon's
death.  The Freehold House was valued
at &pound;6,500, the Diamond Pin at &pound;25.
</p>

<hr /> <!--
<tb>
 -->

<p>
The Net value of his Estate when
aggregated was &pound;108,000.  What did the
Rooker Family receive, and what duties
were payable by them?
